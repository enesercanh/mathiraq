      <h2>What is the IMO?</h2>
      <p>The <strong>International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)</strong> is the most prestigious math competition for high school students around the world. It brings together the brightest young minds from over 100 countries to solve six extremely challenging problems in two days.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Iraq's Participation in the IMO</h2>
      <p>Iraq has been participating in the IMO for several years, proudly sending a national team each summer. The students represent Iraq after qualifying through a rigorous national selection process. Iraqi students have demonstrated increasing potential in recent years, and Math Iraq is here to support and amplify this success.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Must be a pre-university student (not enrolled in university).</li>
        <li>Age must be below 20 on July 1st of the competition year.</li>
        <li>Strong performance in national math selection exams.</li>
        <li>Consistent participation in training camps and mock tests.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Selection Process in Iraq</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Round 1 (School Level):</strong> Organized by the Ministry of Education or math initiatives; students are nominated by schools or apply directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Round 2 (National Test):</strong> Shortlisted students are invited for a nationwide math exam.</li>
        <li><strong>Round 3 (Training Camp & Final Exam):</strong> Top students join national camps for intensive training in Olympiad topics. The final team of 6 is selected based on performance.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Topics Covered in the IMO</h2>
      <p>The IMO doesn't follow a fixed school curriculum. Instead, it tests deep problem-solving ability in these four major fields:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Geometry:</strong> Circles, triangles, inversion, trigonometry, angle chasing, transformations, projective geometry.</li>
        <li><strong>Number Theory:</strong> Divisibility, Diophantine equations, modular arithmetic, prime numbers, greatest common divisors.</li>
        <li><strong>Combinatorics:</strong> Counting, graph theory, pigeonhole principle, recursion, coloring problems, invariants.</li>
        <li><strong>Algebra:</strong> Polynomials, functional equations, inequalities (AM-GM, Cauchy-Schwarz), equations with real numbers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with basic Olympiad books like <em>Problem-Solving Strategies</em> by Arthur Engel and <em>The Art and Craft of Problem Solving</em> by Paul Zeitz.</li>
